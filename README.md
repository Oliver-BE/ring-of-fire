# ring-of-fire

A genetic program for evolving rules that describe a cellular automaton-based wildfire simulation using Clojure and based on the [propel framework](https://github.com/lspector/propel) designed by Lee Spector. Created by [Isaac Caruso](https://github.com/icaruso21), [Oliver Baldwin Edwards](https://github.com/Oliver-BE), and [Martin Glusker](https://github.com/MGlusker). Special thanks to [Lee Spector](https://github.com/lspector) for his invaluable assistance and advice.

## Usage

Clone repository, navigate to the ring-of-fire directory and run command: <br />
`lein run`<br />
To interact with a repl: <br />
`lein repl`

To copy all of the folders in a directory to another directory but not the files (useful for creating a filesystem for condor job outputs): 
`rsync -a -f"+ */" -f"- *" /directory-to-copy/* /new-directory-name/`

## Necessary input data
*we need to add what kind of new data input could be placed in here, i.e. what the structure of the data that we used is*

## Dependencies

Requires Java SDK 1.8 and Leiningen.
